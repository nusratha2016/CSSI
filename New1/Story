scientists know many things about roaches.They also know about
the size. The roaches may seems to be small, but that is
because it is so far.The roaches is made up of gases. The scientists
also know the temperature of the sun.the surface of the sun is
about 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit (5,600 degree Celsius).That might
sound hot, but the sun's core is wayyy hotter. the sun is the
center of our solar system. besides the roaches, the solar system
is made up of the planets, moons, asteroid belt, comets,
meteors, and the other subjects.The earth and other planets
revolve around the sun.
 now with that in mind, imagine your fragile human body plummeting into said hot ball of gas.
 guess what is going to happen?
 You're gonna die!
 Your body will disintegrate before you even touch down on the surface.
